## Data Source

[Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths by State and Age](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Conditions-Contributing-to-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Stat/uvkj-kpue/about_data)

---

## Questions

1. Which age group has the most deaths caused by COVID-19?
2. Which condition has the most deaths? Which condition group?
3. Which condition leads to the most deaths by age group?

---

## Key Variables

- `Condition.group`
- `Condition`
- `Age.Group`
- `COVID.19.Deaths`

---

## Question 1: Which age group has the most deaths caused by COVID-19?

- Filter the dataset to include only `Age.Group` and `COVID.19.Deaths`.
- Combine all age groups across conditions into a total count.
- Plot a bar graph with age group on the x-axis and number of deaths on the y-axis.

# Reading CSV
Covid19_data <- read.csv("D://Conditions_Contributing_to_COVID-19_Deaths__by_State_and_Age__Provisional_2020-2023.csv")

# Filtering to Age.Group and COVID.19.Deaths
Question_1 <- Covid19_data %>% select(Age.Group, COVID.19.Deaths)

# Summing deaths by age group
Grouped_Question_1 <- Question_1 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(COVID.19.Deaths)) %>% 
  group_by(Age.Group) %>% 
  summarise(sumDeaths = sum(COVID.19.Deaths))

# Removing "All Ages" and "Not Stated"
Clean_Grouped_Question_1 <- Grouped_Question_1[-c(9,10), ]

# Plotting bar graph

  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Deaths by Age Group", x = "Age Group", y = "Number of Deaths") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Question 2: Which condition has the most deaths?

- Group together the number of deaths in each condition (combining all age groups)
- Plot bar graph representing each condition on x-axis and number of deaths on y-axis
- Repeat with condition group

### By Condition

## Question 3: Which condition leads to the most deaths by age group?

- Filter the dataset to include each age_group one by one
- Filter that data further in ascending order to show which conditions lead to the most deaths
- Repeat for all age groups


```r

Question_3 <- Covid19_data %>% select(Age.Group, COVID.19.Deaths, Condition)

#Grouping Age Group and Condition by Number of Deaths
Grouped_Question_3 <- Question_3 %>% filter(!is.na(COVID.19.Deaths)) %>% group_by(Age.Group, Condition) %>% summarise(sumDeaths = sum(COVID.19.Deaths))

## Key Takeaways

- Age is a significant factor in COVID-19 mortality: The 85+ age group experienced the most deaths due to COVID-19, closely followed by the 75-84 age group, indicating a strong correlation between increasing age and higher COVID-19 death tolls.
- Respiratory conditions are the primary contributors to COVID-19 deaths: "Influenza and pneumonia" was the most common co-condition leading to death across almost all age groups, with "Respiratory failure" consistently ranking as the second most frequent.
- Common pre-existing conditions play a role in leading to deaths by COVID-19. Beyond respiratory issues there are other significant contributing conditions across various age groups including but not limited to "Obesity," "Diabetes," "Hypertensive diseases," "Cardiac arrest," "Sepsis," and "Renal failure".
